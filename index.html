				<h2>CHICKEN</h2>
				<h3>by 170030734</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally
				from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called
				a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a
				sexually immature female is called a pullet.

				Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
				Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
				(consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

				Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
				billion as of 2018,[3] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world
				than any other bird.[4] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and
				religion, and in language and literature.

				Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
				Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
				Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
				Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the
				"bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
				according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]
			</p>

			<h2>Terminology</h2>
			<p>
				An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and an adult female is called a
				'hen'.[10][11]

				Other terms are:

				'Biddy:' a newly hatched chicken[12][13]
				'Capon:' a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
				'Chick:' a young chicken[14]
				'Chook' /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia, informal)[15]
				'Cockerel:' a young male chicken less than a year old[16]
				'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a
				sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
				'Yardbird:' a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]
				"Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to
				its usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general,
				especially in American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as
				'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.[20]

				'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]
			</p>

			<h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
			<p>
				Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and
				even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]

				The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known
				chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.[30]

			<h3 class="text_m">Social behaviour</h3>

			Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation
			of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking
			order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
			roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
			established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and
			injury.[32]

			When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch
			as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call
			their chicks and encourage them to eat.

			A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
			roosters.[33] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.
			Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning
			calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[34]

			<h3 class="text_m">Crowing</h3>
			Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as
			well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[35]

			<h3 class="text_m">Rooster crowing contests</h3>
			Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a traditional sport in several countries, such
			as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[36] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are
			held with longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster
			crows within a certain time is measured.

			<h3 class="text_m">Courtship</h3>
			To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often
			lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[37] The dance triggers a response in the hen[37] and when she
			responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.

			More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:

			<ul>
				<li>Male approaching the hen</li>
				<li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
				<li>Male waltzing </li>
				<li>Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate)
				</li>
				<li>Male mounting </li>
				<li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back </li>
				<li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[38]</li>
			</ul>
